# Algorithm-Visualizer

View the live demo [here.](https://zaidsbaghal.github.io/Algorithm-Visualizer/)

This is an interactive algorithm visualizer that allows you to see first-hand how these algorithms look step-by-step. 
The algorithms implemented include: 

* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Depth-First Search
* Breadth-First Search
* Dijkstra's Shortest Path 
* A* Search

This currently does not work on mobile devices so please open on your computer.

I had a lot of fun building this project. Not only did this help me strengthen my web development knowledge, but I was able to througouhly understand many of the implemented algorithms on a micro scale. My grasp on data structures and algorithms is much stronger due to building this. 

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
